See likes in Instagram again

[Instagram’s test to hide like counts expands to the US and across the globe](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964865/instagram-test-hide-like-counts-expands-us-globally)
Fortunatelly, they hide it only on front-end right now. So it's easy to show it with userscript.

⚠️ right now it works only when you open the post

TODO:
1. show likes on hover for grid
2. show likes in feed
